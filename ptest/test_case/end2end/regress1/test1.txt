# ptest assumes you have done the following 
#  - gsql_admin --configure   (configure deployment enviroment)
#  - gpkg.sh  (package your dev work)
#  - mv output from gpkg.sh to IUM package.pool location (move pkg to deployment folder)
#  - gsql_admin pkg-install (install pkg)

# 1. Put your graph setup ddl in ptest/resources folder, and replace "tango_load.gsql" 
#    Put your test data set in ptest/resources/data folder, and make your sys.data_root
#    point to ptest/resources/data. Then use sys.data_root in your loading job ddl.
#
./resources/common/gsql/gsql ./resources/tango_load.gsql

# keep this line intact, which restart all service including REST, GPE and GSE.
~/.gium/gsql_admin restart -f -y

curl -s -X GET 'http://localhost:9000/fromUser/0'
curl -s -X GET 'http://localhost:9000/fromUser/4'
curl -s -X GET 'http://localhost:9000/fromUser/5'
