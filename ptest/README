HOW TO GUIDE

In below struct, users will only work under resources/ and test_case/ directory.
1) In resources/, put your dependent resources, such as libraries and configs, here.
2) In test_case/, put your test cases here, follow the structures.
3) Run the test framework
     ./ptest end2end.sh 1 2 ...
     or
     ./ptest end2end.sh

     end2end.sh is your test program driver file name, found in drivers folder.
     The numbers represent the regress number: 1 means test_case/end2end/regress1
     To run 1* and 2*, you can do
         ./ptest end2end.sh 1\* 2\*
