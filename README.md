Product and Projects

 --- Quick start ---
- edit config/proj.conf if necessary
- (if you are using git ssh authentication)
   "./gworkspace.sh -u" to update the workspace
  (if you are using git https authentication)
   "./gworkspace.sh -x https [user password]" to update the workspace
- ". .gsql_setup_dev_env.source" to setup the dev env.
- coding...
   if you are change more than one repo, run "./gworkspace.sh -s" to
   check it any repo has change (dirty). Once commit, do remember
   to push in each repo. "./gworkspace.sh -i" will give more info.


 --- Build Package ---
- under the same dev env, ( source .gsql_setup_dev_env.source)
   * edit config/pkg.config if needed. Don't execute this file even it's executable.
   * you may also edit or add files under src/customer/config
   * ./gpkg.sh

 --- Deployment using IUM ----
- put package under ium/pkgs
- put config file under ium/configs (sample: deploy_pkg/mgnt_cli/configs/conf_poc4_base.yaml)
- install pacage (sample: deploy_pkg/mgnt_cli/scripts/init_all.sh)

Notes:
- you can control the log level of rest server, zookeeper and kafka in conf_xxx.yaml
- GPE/GSE are now taking single command line arguments, which is a file (*.property) generated by IUM.
  e.g., below is poc_gpe_server setup
  File: deploy_pkg/config/gpe/gpe1.property
          /data/rc4//config/gpe/gpe1.conf
          /data/rc4//config/gpe/graph_config.yaml
          1
  Command: poc_gpe_server deploy_pkg/config/gpe/gpe1.property
