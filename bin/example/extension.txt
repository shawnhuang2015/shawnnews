1. Load 1 file to multiple vertices and/or edges.

 load "./persons.csv" to vertex person values ($0,$0,$1), 
                      to vertex movie values ($0,$0,$1,$2,$3),
                      to edge roles values ($0,$1,$2) using Separator=",", Header="true";

2. change backend to MT for edge loading.

3. Make dump= true  a default option for sample

4. Support Aggregate transformation on columns to support kv_list attribute type. Such as uint32_uint32_kv_list, uint32_udt_kv_list etc. 

5. TokenValidationBank.cpp + Sanity check binary(schema checking as well as token constraints)

The syntax is simple, for a kv_list attribute type, we use 

   - key($1):val(min($0),max($2)) group by ($0,$1)  //group by on column 0 and 1. Key is is column 1. Value is two column aggregates.

   - e.g.

      load "./roles.csv"  to vertex person values ($0,key($1):val(min($2),max($3)) group by ($0,f($1)), $2) using Separator=",", Header="false";

6. KeyValue list column such as a,b,c:d splits to multiple vertex keys.
