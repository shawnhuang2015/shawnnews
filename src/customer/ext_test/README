 6) Number of vertices per round  
 7) Bad record seed  
 8) Delete record seed 
 9) Update record seed
 
About seed: If bad record seed is 17, then bad records will apply to vertex / edge (sum of source id and target id) mod 17 == 0. For vertex which id is 17,34,... will be bad record. For edge which from 8 to 9 (sum 17), 25 to 26 (sum 51), ... will be bad records.
