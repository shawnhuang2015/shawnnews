HOW TO GUIDE

In below struct, users will only work under drivers/ resources/ and test_case/ directory.
1) In drivers/, put your test program driver.
2) In resources/, put your dependent resources libraries or configs here.
3) In test_case/, put your test cases here, follows the structures.
4) Run the test framework
     ./gtest program_driver 1 2 ...

     program_driver is your test program driver file name, found in drivers folder.
     The numbers represent the regress number: 1 means test_case/program_driver/regress1
     You can use '\*' to represent multiple directories:
         ./gr.sh program_driver \*
     To run 1* and 2*, you can do
         ./gr.sh program_driver 1\* 2\*
